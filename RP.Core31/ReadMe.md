## You have created this project using the custom project template provided.

# ToDo:

If you run this first time, the content might not properly align. The reason for that is, UI libraries such as JavaScript and bootstrap required for this template are not distributed with the template package. So we have to download them after creating the project.  To get the required libraries, follow the following steps.

	* Open the libman.json file in the Visual Studio 2019 IDE
	* Just add a letter or space at the bottom and delete it again. It will trigger the file as an edited file.
	* Now save the file.
	
When you save the file, it will automatically download the required libraries into relevant folders under wwwroot/lib folder.

## Validation Scripts

Also, there is one thing you should always check if you download a different version of jquery-validation files. You must update the version number in the /Shared/ _ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml file.
